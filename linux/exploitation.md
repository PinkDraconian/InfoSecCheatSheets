# Exploiting PATH with SUID binary
Whenever there's a SUID binary, and that binary executes other binaries without using the full path, we can use that to get code exec.

Example: `vuln` binary with SUID set, runs `pwd` without specifying the full path.
We can create a `pwd` file in /tmp that runs `/bin/bash`
Then we set `PATH=/tmp:$PATH` and run `vuln`. Our binary will then be executed with the permissions of the owner of vuln
